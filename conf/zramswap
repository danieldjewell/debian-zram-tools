# Specifies amount of zram devices to create.
# By default, zramswap-start will use all available cores.
#CORES=1

# Specifies the amount of RAM that should be used for zram
# based on a percentage the total amount of available memory
#PERCENTAGE=10

# Specifies a static amount of RAM that should be used for
# the ZRAM devices, this is in MiB
#ALLOCATION=256

# Specifies the priority for the swap devices, see swapon(2)
# for more details.
#PRIORITY=100

# Specifies compression algorithm to use
# By default, it's zstd 
# zram utilizes the kernel's crypto/compress interface
# to utilize other algorithms, you'll need the appropriate kernel module
# or have that algorithm built in 
# The <compressionAlgorithm>_compress.ko module is the required file
# 
# Try checking /lib/modules/<version>/kernel to see what's available 
# e.g. in the kernel dir: find . -iname '*compress*' 
# Typically, lz4, lz4hc, and zstd are in recent kernels
# Others might be built-in
#
# You can try checking the /lib/modules/<version>/kernel/modules.builtin 
# file to see what's in there: cat modules.builtin | grep compress
#
# ZRAM_SWAP_COMPRESSION="zstd"
